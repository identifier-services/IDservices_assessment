This folder contains files needed to carry out the use cases, organized in the following folders:

diagrams:
General images, e.g.for  modeling data, in formats for VUE (Visual Understanding Environment), PDF, or other.

file locations: 
Where the actual data files for each use case are located (as URIs). If no URI is available, supply at least an identifier (e.g., SRA or BioProject ID)

metadata files:
Files containing the metadata for each project, on the specimens, sequencing process, etc. Preferred format is CSV

testcase mappings:
Spreasheets that show how the entities in each test case (show in a workflow diagram) map to identifier type and metdata needs.

testcase workflow diagrams:
VUE diagrams showing how specific use cases a modeled. These are subsets of the general genomics data model.
